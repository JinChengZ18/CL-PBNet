The aim is to predict this classification, given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database, the class of a pixel is coded as a number.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Landsat satellite data is one of the many sources of information available for a scene. The interpretation of a scene by integrating spatial data of diverse types and resolutions including multispectral and radar data, maps indicating topography, land use etc. is expected to assume significant importance with the onset of an era characterised by integrative approaches to remote sensing (for example, NASA's Earth Observing System commencing this decade). Existing statistical methods are ill-equipped for handling such diverse data types. Note that this is not true for Landsat MSS data considered in isolation (as in this sample database). This data satisfies the important requirements of being numerical and at a single resolution, and standard maximum-likelihood classification performs very well. Consequently, for this data, it should be interesting to compare the performance of other methods against the statistical approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne frame of Landsat MSS imagery consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands. Two of these are in the visible region (corresponding approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum) and two are in the (near) infra-red. Each pixel is a 8-bit binary word, with 0 corresponding to black and 255 to white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is about 80m x 80m. Each image contains 2340 x 3380 such pixels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe database is a (tiny) sub-area of a scene, consisting of 82 x 100 pixels. Each line of data corresponds to a 3x3 square neighbourhood of pixels completely contained within the 82x100 sub-area. Each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands (converted to ASCII) of each of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighbourhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel. The number is a code for the following classes:\\r\\n\\r\\nNumber\\t\\t\\tClass\\r\\n1\\t\\t\\tred soil\\r\\n2\\t\\t\\tcotton crop\\r\\n3\\t\\t\\tgrey soil\\r\\n4\\t\\t\\tdamp grey soil\\r\\n5\\t\\t\\tsoil with vegetation stubble\\r\\n6\\t\\t\\tmixture class (all types present)\\r\\n7\\t\\t\\tvery damp grey soil\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nNB. There are no examples with class 6 in this dataset.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe data is given in random order and certain lines of data have been removed so you cannot reconstruct the original image from this dataset.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn each line of data the four spectral values for the top-left pixel are given first followed by the four spectral values for the top-middle pixel and then those for the top-right pixel, and so on with the pixels read out in sequence left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Thus, the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes 17,18,19 and 20. If you like you can use only these four attributes, while ignoring the others. This avoids the problem which arises when a 3x3 neighbourhood straddles a boundary.\\r\\n\", 'purpose': None, 'funded_by': None, 'instances_represent': None, 'recommended_data_splits': None, 'sensitive_data': None, 'preprocessing_description': None, 'variable_info': 'The attributes are numerical, in the range 0 to 255.', 'citation': None}}\n",

Each row concerns hospital records of patients diagnosed with diabetes, who underwent laboratory, medications, and stayed up to 14 days. The goal is to determine the early readmission of the patient within 30 days of discharge.\\nThe problem is important for the following reasons. Despite high-quality evidence showing improved clinical outcomes for diabetic patients who receive various preventive and therapeutic interventions, many patients do not receive them. This can be partially attributed to arbitrary diabetes management in hospital environments, which fail to attend to glycemic control. Failure to provide proper diabetes care not only increases the managing costs for the hospitals (as the patients are readmitted) but also impacts the morbidity and mortality of the patients, who may face complications associated with diabetes.\\n', 'area': 'Health and Medicine', 'tasks': ['Classification', 'Clustering'], 'characteristics': ['Multivariate'], 'num_instances': 101766, 'num_features': 47, 'feature_types': ['Categorical', 'Integer'], 'demographics': ['Race', 'Gender', 'Age'], 'target_col': ['readmitted'], 'index_col': ['encounter_id', 'patient_nbr'], 'has_missing_values': 'yes', 'missing_values_symbol': 'NaN', 'year_of_dataset_creation': 2014, 'last_updated': 'Tue Sep 24 2024', 'dataset_doi': '10.24432/C5230J', 'creators': ['John Clore', 'Krzysztof Cios', 'Jon DeShazo', 'Beata Strack'], 'intro_paper': {'ID': 225, 'type': 'NATIVE', 'title': 'Impact of HbA1c Measurement on Hospital Readmission Rates: Analysis of 70,000 Clinical Database Patient Record', 'authors': 'Beata Strack, Jonathan DeShazo, Chris Gennings, Juan Olmo, Sebastian Ventura, Krzysztof Cios, John Clore', 'venue': 'BioMed Research International, vol. 2014', 'year': 2014, 'journal': None, 'DOI': None, 'URL': 'https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/', 'sha': None, 'corpus': None, 'arxiv': None, 'mag': None, 'acl': None, 'pmid': None, 'pmcid': None}, 'additional_info': {'summary': 'The dataset represents ten years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks.

The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHISTORY:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis data was originally gathered at the TI in 1986-87 by JP Siebert. It was partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd. The original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing 3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects. Measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a classification rule tree by means of computer induction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis object recognition strategy was successfully used to discriminate between silhouettes of model cars, vans and buses viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rule tree classification performance compared favourably to MDC (Minimum Distance Classifier) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbour) statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and computational efficiency. An investigation of these rule trees generated by example indicated that the tree structure was heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects, and grouped similar object views into single decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDESCRIPTION:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance, skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic measures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and compactness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour \"Corgie\" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation (34.2 degrees to the horizontal). The vehicles were placed on a diffuse backlit surface (lightbox). The vehicles were painted matte black to minimise highlights. The images were captured using a CRS4000 framestore connected to a vax 750. All images were captured with a spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels quantised to 64 greylevels. These images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes, negated (to comply with the processing requirements of BINATTS) and thereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink HIPS modules to remove \"salt and pepper\" image noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. 0 and 180 degrees corresponded to \"head on\" and \"rear\" views respectively while 90 and 270 corresponded to profiles in opposite directions. Two sets of 60 images, each set covering a full 360 degree rotation, were captured for each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between images. These datasets are known as e2 and e3 respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\n A further two sets of images, e4 and e5, were captured with the camera at elevations of 37.5 degs and 30.8 degs respectively. These sets also contain 60 images per vehicle apart from e4.van which contains only 46 owing to the difficulty of containing the van in the image at some orientations.\\r\\n', 'purpose': None, 'funded_by': None, 'instances_represent': None, 'recommended_data_splits': None, 'sensitive_data': None, 'preprocessing_description': None, 'variable_info': 'ATTRIBUTES\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tCOMPACTNESS\\t(average perim)**2/area\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tCIRCULARITY\\t(average radius)**2/area\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tDISTANCE CIRCULARITY\\tarea/(av.distance from border)**2\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tRADIUS RATIO\\t(max.rad-min.rad)/av.radius\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tPR.AXIS ASPECT RATIO\\t(minor axis)/(major axis)\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tMAX.LENGTH ASPECT RATIO\\t(length perp. max length)/(max length)\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tSCATTER RATIO\\t(inertia about minor axis)/(inertia about major axis)\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tELONGATEDNESS\\t\\tarea/(shrink width)**2\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tPR.AXIS RECTANGULARITY\\tarea/(pr.axis length*pr.axis width)\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tMAX.LENGTH RECTANGULARITY area/(max.length*length perp. to this)\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tSCALED VARIANCE \\t(2nd order moment about minor axis)/area\\r\\n\\tALONG MAJOR AXIS\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tSCALED VARIANCE \\t(2nd order moment about major axis)/area\\r\\n\\tALONG MINOR AXIS \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tSCALED RADIUS OF GYRATION\\t(mavar+mivar)/area\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tSKEWNESS ABOUT \\t(3rd order moment about major axis)/sigma_min**3\\r\\n\\tMAJOR AXIS\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tSKEWNESS ABOUT \\t(3rd order moment about minor axis)/sigma_maj**3\\r\\n\\tMINOR AXIS\\r\\n\\t  \\t\\r\\n\\tKURTOSIS ABOUT \\t(4th order moment about major axis)/sigma_min**4\\r\\n\\tMINOR AXIS  \\r\\n\\t  \\t\\r\\n\\tKURTOSIS ABOUT \\t(4th order moment about minor axis)/sigma_maj**4\\r\\n\\tMAJOR AXIS\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tHOLLOWS RATIO\\t(area of hollows)/(area of bounding polygon)\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t Where sigma_maj**2 is the variance along the major axis and sigma_min**2 is the variance along the minor axis, and\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tarea of hollows= area of bounding poly-area of object \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t The area of the bounding polygon is found as a side result of the computation to find the maximum length.
